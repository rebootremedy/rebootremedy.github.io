<section id="recovery-doubt" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="recovery-doubt">Recovery doubt</h2>
<p>Recovery is a topic of great interest among brothers. Many start rebooting because of physical issues, hoping that by doing so, they can regain their health. Whether others recover or not can impact one’s confidence in reboot. If it seems that many do not recover, one might lose the motivation and confidence to continue. Some might think, if recovery is impossible, why bother abstaining at all? This leads to further negligence and potential future health problems.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a case study:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Soaring Eagle, I’ve heard some say they can’t recover and it’s distressing. I’m not wavering anymore and know I must continue. I’m 23 and have been abstaining for nearly a year. Can I recover?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There’s no need to feel uncomfortable. Some recover, others don’t—it’s quite normal. If you do everything correctly, there’s a great chance of recovery. Keep going! I suggest you engage in physical exercise and pay attention to wellness practices. Focus on learning about health through articles and videos to enhance your awareness. Rebooting without nurturing yourself will hardly lead to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Many brothers become disheartened upon seeing others not recover, which shakes their confidence and discourages them from continuing. Posts that undermine the confidence of those practicing abstinence still appear frequently. If such posts affect you, it’s detrimental to your effort to reboot. Many who try to reboot aren’t firm in their resolve to begin with, and reading these articles can easily lead them to reconsider. For example, if ten people attempt reboot and only one truly recovers, you should learn from the one who has succeeded. Those who truly recover usually have their own methods and experiences in health management and recovery.</p>
<p>Here’s a piece of advice for everyone: If you want to recover, consult those who have actually recovered. Those who haven’t will only tell you that recovery is impossible. I myself had almost given up hope due to severe hair loss and had visited many forums that said recovery was unlikely. There were also issues with graying hair, and it was rare to see recovery cases. But you must understand, just because you haven’t seen it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. It’s like playing the lottery; just because you haven’t won 5 million doesn’t mean no one has. Of course, the odds of recovering from masturbation symptoms aren’t that low. If you do everything right, especially maintaining good health practices, the likelihood of recovery is still very high. Even if not completely recovered, you can significantly improve and be much better than before. Some have severe damage or a long history of excessive masturbation, making recovery as slow as drawing silk—one thread at a time. If wellness practices are poor or if nocturnal emissions can’t be controlled, there may even be setbacks. Only by maintaining patience can one hope to recover fully eventually.</p>
<p>Recovery is a systematic project, something all experienced rebooters should understand. Completely reboot is difficult, and so is recovery. Overcoming one difficulty is hard enough, let alone two, which requires a high level of commitment to both reboot and health. When faced with difficulties, many worry they can’t handle it, but really, once you master the methods, it no longer feels difficult. Mastery makes challenges manageable. Recovery too requires understanding the right methods. There’s always a method to success; you just haven’t found it yet, similar to finding game cheats. At that time, I was always looking for and trying recovery methods. The ones that helped me the most were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Kidney strengthening exercises, which helped control the frequency of nocturnal emissions<br>
</li>
<li>Standing meditation and seated meditation<br>
</li>
<li>Aerobic exercise<br>
</li>
<li>Moxibustion</li>
</ol>
<p>Moxibustion was indispensable. It cured my allergic rhinitis and hemorrhoids and was beneficial for improving my physical condition. Moxibustion isn’t expensive, but you must have a good understanding and knowledge of it, continuously summarizing practical experience and deepening your understanding through learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="plateau-period" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="plateau-period">The plateau period in recovery</h2>
<p>Some brothers do engage in wellness activities, but they might feel their recovery has stalled after reaching a certain point, which is actually encountering a plateau period. It’s normal to hit such a plateau. To break through, one should seek methods, much like overcoming a technical difficulty; advancing in wellness methods and awareness is necessary.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to running: if you work hard and reach 12 seconds in the 100-meter dash, you might find yourself stuck at 12 seconds without further improvement. Having an experienced coach would be beneficial then. A coach can guide you on how to break through the plateau and further improve your performance to reach 11 seconds or even 10 seconds. I read an article by a track coach who stated that professional athletes need at least three years of systematic training to run under 10 seconds, exceptional talents notwithstanding.</p>
<p>If we encounter a plateau in recovery, we should study more wellness articles, try various wellness practices, and find the one that suits us best to stick with. For instance, standing meditation — if you can master it and persist, many physical symptoms can be greatly improved. There are also real cases of people alleviating or eliminating diseases through Tai Chi or yoga practice. Dietary supplements are good, but not as effective as exercise supplements; knowing how to exercise properly is a major topic. Many know aerobic exercise is beneficial and run daily, sweating profusely, only to find themselves weakened and fatigued, lacking energy. Traditional Chinese medicine is correct in saying excessive sweating harms yang energy. Young individuals with strong constitutions might sustain this, but it can lead to problems if continued. The Ma’s Army athletics team placed a high priority on post-exercise recovery and conditioning, daily brewing medicinal soups for the athletes.</p>
<p>My recovery also involved continually breaking through plateaus. I read about heel raises stimulating the Chengshan acupoint on the calves, similar to the “Shake Seven Times at the Back” movement in the Eight Section Brocade exercises, so I did it hundreds, even thousands of times daily, even while walking. I found that heel raises not only improved my constitution but also increased my jumping power, making my calves stronger.</p>
<p>However, when practicing any technique, one must grasp the essentials and avoid blind, aimless practice. For example, some brothers heard squats were beneficial and practiced 500 a day, only to end up damaging their knees. When squatting, the knees should not exceed the toes, and both should point in the same direction to avoid damaging the knees. Otherwise, long-term misalignment can put all the stress on the knees, leading to wear or other knee issues. We must practice correctly to avoid blind, unguided exercise.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-case-study" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="a-case-study">A case study</h2>
<p>Here’s another case study:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“For nocturnal emissions, kidney-strengthening exercises are used, and prostatitis is managed with medication and nurturing. Persisting in these for over half a year can lead to more than 80% recovery. However, based on my over a year of moderating forums, not a single person has posted about curing premature ejaculation after recovery. Some have tried abstaining for a year without resolving their premature ejaculation, and for many, there has been no change at all. It seems that, to a large extent, once premature ejaculation occurs, it might be permanent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A forum member posted this. Soaring Eagle, do you think this makes sense? It seems there are no cases in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>This brother has a point, recovery is a systematic project. From my experience, there are posts from people who have shown improvement; recovery cases do exist. However, many have been masturbating for a long time and have severely depleted their vitality, so recovery from premature ejaculation and impotence usually takes years and requires complete cessation of masturbation plus nurturing. Both aspects must be fully addressed, including strict emission control. Many can’t even fully stop masturbating, so how can they talk about recovery? Without a sense of how to nurture themselves, how can they talk about recovery? Keep pushing!</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>I have emphasized the importance of nurturing one’s health in early articles. Why do my responses always stress reboot and nurturing health? Because I deeply realize the importance of nurturing for recovery. Merely reboot without nurturing won’t lead to ideal recovery. Many put all their hopes on rebooting, thinking that once they start, everything will be fine. This is a misconception. Reboot is just one aspect; nurturing is the key focus. The saying goes, “30% treatment, 70% nurturing,” and nurturing includes both sexual abstinence and a variety of health knowledge and practices. The importance of nurturing is undeniable.</p>
<p>Moreover, many place all their hopes on doctors and medications, lacking any sense of self-nurturing, thinking that kidney weakness is like a cold that can be cured with a few pills. This understanding is incorrect. Active treatment should be sought for severe or persistent symptoms, but one should not place all hopes on the doctor. For symptoms caused by kidney weakness, focusing on self-care is actually the most crucial. There’s a saying: “Prostatitis is nurtured back to health, not cured back to health.” Just like a new car, if properly maintained, it can still be almost as good as new after a year; without proper maintenance, it might even need several repairs.</p>
<p>Self-care is incredibly important. Professional athletes immediately engage in ice packs, massages, infrared physical therapy, and acupuncture after training. The recovery methods are numerous, and NBA players use a variety of high-tech maintenance techniques that most people have never even heard of. My recovery was largely due to the extensive efforts I put into health maintenance. I have always been studying traditional Chinese medicine and health maintenance, and I have personally tried many health practices.</p>
<p>It have been rumored that I only masturbated a few hundred times over more than a decade, which is why I recovered. How could that be possible? At my worst, I did it up to six times a day, and eventually, only water would come out, sometimes nothing at all. My addiction was severe and led me straight to a hellish state of symptoms. I masturbated thousands of times. Those who have read my “Abstinence as Medicine” series know how severe my damage was. Developing severe neurological issues from masturbation is excruciatingly painful. Compared to this, prostatitis seems minor. At the time, I constantly thought about suicide and lived every day in a state of anxiety and panic, surrounded by people who couldn’t understand what I was feeling. I was on the verge of a breakdown, a virtual walking pharmacy. I still have a box of expired medications at home, filled with dozens of different drugs. I keep it to remind myself of the hell I lived through because of staying up late and indulging my desires. I never want to return to that kind of symptomatic hell again, which is truly inhuman torture. I’ve known a brother who, out of curiosity, joined groups for anxiety disorder and quickly left in fear because they found the people too despondent, discussing only their painful symptoms in a very depressing atmosphere. Many harbored thoughts of suicide. So later, I came to a realization: Masturbation is hell!</p>
<p>Some brothers have quit for a long time without recovering, leading them to believe that recovery is a lie. This thinking is like someone who has only seen white swans and thus narrowly believes that black swans do not exist. This kind of reasoning can indeed undermine a lot of confidence. I used to think prostatitis was incurable too, as many people I talked to said it recurred and that medication was only a temporary solution. Many people have severe depletion from long periods of masturbation, and recovery is slow. Experienced brothers have summarized that the slow recovery period lasts over a year. That year should be dedicated to rebooting and nurturing health, particularly focusing on health maintenance, active exercise, and moderate aerobic exercise, which can significantly alleviate prostatitis. Thus, I always advocate for regular, moderate aerobic exercise for faster recovery from prostatitis.</p>
<p>However, moderation is key. If you sweat profusely every time, it might have the opposite effect on recovery. Now, I mainly do brisk walking. When my body starts to heat up and is about to sweat, I slow down, trying not to sweat. Sweating is a double-edged sword. On one hand, toxins are expelled from the body with sweat, but at the same time, vital essence is also lost through sweating. Traditional Chinese medicine says: “Sweat is vital essence.” Sweat is the fluid of the heart. The human body has a form of energy that can transform into several forms, such as sweat, body fluids, and essence, similar to water, which can be in gaseous, solid (ice), or liquid states. Essentially, it’s all energy. Humans are energy beings with an invisible energy value. The operation of all aspects of the body requires this energy support, just like the batteries inside an Energizer Bunny. When you fall ill due to masturbation or bad lifestyle habits, it’s actually a decline in energy. Masturbation, staying up late, anger, heavy sweating, exposure to cold, and other external factors can cause energy loss. Listening to headphones excessively can damage the kidneys, and talking too much can deplete vital energy. There are many ways to lose energy, including sitting, watching, or listening for too long. Our task is to conserve energy and minimize energy loss. Energy leaks in daily life are hard to prevent, happening unnoticed, like excessive thinking, which also drains energy. Without a sense of health maintenance, one might not even be aware of it.</p>
<p>Li Min Qu once said in her book that postpartum women should not be directly exposed to wind or read books, because after childbirth, women are physically weak, meaning their energy levels are very low and their resistance is diminished. Exposure to wind could easily lead to illness. Reading can lead to liver damage and energy loss. Since the body is already weak, it cannot afford further energy depletion, which is why quiet recuperation is recommended postpartum. Some abstainers might ask why exercise seems to increase strength. This is due to the principle of supercompensation in fitness, where exercise can restore you to a higher level than before. However, this presupposes that your body is relatively healthy and not too weak. If your energy levels are already low, your body cannot withstand the strain. When your body is in good condition, more exercise is beneficial, of course, referring to moderate exercise; when your body is very weak, it is best to adopt a strategy of rest, otherwise exercise might backfire. For example, I once learned about a cycling coach who continued teaching while having a cold, which led to fatal myocarditis at just over 20 years old.</p>
<p>The reasons for the scarcity of premature ejaculation recovery cases in the abstinence forums include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Recovery from premature ejaculation and impotence usually takes years, and many people in the rebooting forums have not been abstaining for a long period.</p></li>
<li><p>Recovery requires a high level of awareness in health maintenance; merely abstaining without nurturing will not yield ideal results.</p></li>
<li><p>Inability to break through the recovery plateau; the methods and means of recovery are not yet adequate.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of rebooters are unmarried, and many who have rebooted for over half a year are not likely to easily try to test their recovery.</p></li>
<li><p>After a long period without sexual activity, the first instance of resuming sexual life can likely result in “honeymoon premature ejaculation.”</p></li>
<li><p>Many brothers do not abstain thoroughly; their abstinence is intermittent, which significantly impacts recovery.</p></li>
<li><p>If rebooting is practiced solely for the recovery of sexual function, there’s a high likelihood of relapse due to the motivation to test this recovery, which makes maintaining abstinence challenging.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sexual dysfunction is hopeful for recovery, and I have seen recovery cases. Recently, a married brother said that he used to suffer from premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction, unable to achieve an erection, but after rebooting for six months, he could achieve an erection and complete sexual intercourse. Although recovery cases are not numerous, that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. If everything is properly addressed, there is still a great chance of recovery, at least some improvement, better than before. If a brother post in the forum saying, “I’ve recovered from premature ejaculation, I lasted half an hour or even more than an hour, or the duration with my girlfriend has significantly increased,” such posts might be deleted because the forum does not promote premarital sexual activity. Additionally, a long duration of sexual activity isn’t necessarily good; it could be an ejaculatory disorder, and prolonged erections can also harm the prostate. In any case, both too long and too short durations are not ideal. Those recovering from premature ejaculation and impotence should ask more from married abstainers who have been abstaining for over six months, as they have more authority to speak on the matter. However, married brothers are a minority in the forum, and not many are firmly committed to abstinence, plus the support and cooperation of their spouses are required.</p>
<p>In fact, many unmarried brothers have their own experiences, such as the restoration of morning erections, improved quality of morning erections, and more consistent morning erections. If only one out of ten morning erections is good, that is not considered stable. When your morning erection quality becomes very good and stable, that is a sign of recovering sexual function. Some rebooters may say their morning erections aren’t great, but their sexual activity is fine. This situation exists, but I can confirm that this isn’t the optimal state of your body. This involves the concept of “vigor”! Many people find that towards the end, their semen just trickles out; they have weak ejaculations and their ejaculatory distance is not what it used to be, which is a sign of lost vigor and diminished kidney energy. I have written about the mysteries of ejaculatory distance in one of the seasons, and interested brothers can check it out.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="to-recovery-better">To recovery better</h2>
<p>To better facilitate recovery, avoid staying up late and sitting for long periods. Health maintenance is a science. Only by learning, thinking, and practicing more can you find the path of health maintenance that suits you. Continually enhancing your awareness of health maintenance allows you to know more and strive for continuous improvement in this area, thus greatly increasing your chances of recovery. Particularly, avoid lifestyles that damage vitality and health, and pay attention to emotional management. Prostatitis can also recur, especially after nocturnal emissions, so we need to control the frequency of emissions. Be mindful in all aspects, so you can greatly reduce the frequency of symptoms recurring, eventually stabilize them, and finally recover. The pattern of recovery is to move from a negative cycle to an unstable positive cycle, then by paying attention to health maintenance, you can transition from an unstable positive cycle to a stable positive cycle.</p>
<p>Negative cycle → Unstable positive cycle → Stable positive cycle!</p>
<p>The recovery of other symptoms generally follows this pattern too. It’s normal for symptoms to recur; the key is not to worry, but to take good care of oneself and reduce the frequency of these recurrences. It’s like walking a tightrope; at first, you keep falling off, but with experience and lessons learned, you gradually stabilize and rarely fall.</p>
</section>
<section id="irreversible-theory" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="irreversible-theory">About the irreversible theory</h2>
<p>Regarding the “irreversible theory”, there is some truth to it, as it is a conclusion drawn from personal experiences by those who reboot. When I was suffering from a neurological condition, the idea that it was irreversible was also popular among my peers. About irreversibility, there was a famous saying: “We are like a broken vase, no matter how well it’s glued back together, it can never be completely restored to its pre-broken state; there will always be cracks.” This analogy holds some truth. Can a person, through rebooting and nurturing health, return to their pre-developmental state? The human body naturally ages; even without masturbation, your body would still deteriorate over time—indulgence merely accelerates this process, even to the extent that a 20-year-old might show the physical traits of a 60-year-old, advancing their aging by decades. However, irreversibility is not absolute. Some abstainers, after quitting, actively exercise and feel that their bodies are stronger and their spirits are better than before. From this perspective, isn’t that a better recovery than before?</p>
<p>Can the various symptoms caused by masturbation be reversed? Actually, recovery has two meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning to the state before masturbation, which is basically impossible because humans naturally age.<br>
</li>
<li>Recovering to a symptom-free state with vitality and vigor, which is achievable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you are a deeply entrenched brother, rebooting and nurturing health can significantly alleviate your condition, preventing it from worsening. One fact is certain: if you neither reboot nor nurture your health, your body will deteriorate faster, leading to even worse outcomes. If you gain a deep understanding and mastery in nurturing health, your chances of recovery will increase significantly. I have seen many pessimistic views, but I have never wavered because I believe I can recover to a symptom-free state.</p>
<p>Seeing cases of recovery can inspire everyone to move forward. Seeing cases without recovery should not cause despair. Just because someone else hasn’t recovered doesn’t mean you can’t either. What we need to do is strengthen our resolve to reboot, then focus on our health practices, seek active treatment when necessary, but always keep in mind that nurturing health is key to recovery. You must commit deeply to learning and practicing health maintenance. Health maintenance involves both physical and mental aspects; it’s crucial to cultivate the mind, do good deeds, accumulate virtue, and spread positive energy. When the mind is right, the body will follow suit. It’s like a puzzle where one side is a world map and the other side is a portrait. It takes a long time to complete the world map, but only a few minutes to complete the portrait. If the portrait is correctly assembled, the world map will also be correct. Cultivating the mind is like working on the portrait; it’s more important than physical cultivation, and the essence of health maintenance is nurturing the mind.</p>

<p>Next season, I will specifically recommend a secret for restoring appearance. Mastering this secret will bring transformative changes to your appearance. Please look forward to it.</p>
<p>This season, I offer a poem:</p>
<p>“Masturbation is Hell”</p>
<div class="no-indent">
<p>I see, shells fired at China,<br>
Each packed with adult videos.<br>
China’s youth, by the millions, fall,<br>
Alongside flyers preaching harmless moderation.<br>
These flyers make the youth feel justified in their actions,<br>
But the symptoms won’t spare them.<br>
Symptoms pull them back to reality.<br>
Like frogs in slowly boiling water, they’ll awaken eventually.<br>
They know the harmlessness theory is unreliable,<br>
Because the symptoms are clear.<br>
After each indulgence,<br>
A hint of regret surfaces first, then the harmlessness theory,<br>
Numbing themselves with this view, deceiving, comforting,<br>
Falling deeper into the pit of masturbation,<br>
Unable to control, unable to escape.<br>
The innocent gaze is gone,<br>
The clear, bright complexion vanished,<br>
The sunny, open demeanor lost.<br>
The person in the mirror has become two-faced,<br>
In the eyes of parents, teachers, peers, he’s still the same,<br>
But only he knows he’s no longer the pure self he once was.<br>
Worse yet, the mirror reflects a walking corpse,<br>
A monster with a face full of pus and acne,<br>
Cheeks sunken or face swollen,<br>
With a ghostly, sleazy look, a complete waste to behold.<br>
I see a young man tearfully holding a photo from before he started,<br>
The child in the picture is handsome and refined,<br>
While he now, is just filth that disgusts even himself.<br>
I see a young man avoiding mirrors,<br>
Because the reflection has become hideously grotesque,<br>
Unrecognizable from his former self,<br>
Now, he wants to smash every mirror,<br>
Remembering how he used to love looking at his reflection,<br>
Now only boundless inferiority and despair envelope him like dark clouds.<br>
I see a young man visiting the doctor,<br>
The doctor coldly diagnoses,<br>
“You have prostatitis, you have varicocele, you have premature ejaculation.”<br>
I see him at the cashier,<br>
Paying the price for his indulgence.<br>
I see a young man on the operating table,<br>
Asking himself why he’s there,<br>
Then cursing vehemently in his mind:<br>
“Damn masturbation! Damn the harmlessness theory! It’s ruined me!”<br>
Helpless, lying on the table like a lamb to the slaughter,<br>
After enough masturbation,<br>
You’ll find your life has turned into a tragedy.<br>
Happiness so brief, while pain shadows you constantly,<br>
Tormenting you over and over.<br>
In the end, you’ll realize masturbation causes many symptoms,<br>
Of which you initially knew only two or three,<br>
But there are dozens, even hundreds.<br>
You’ve masturbated too much, yet knew too little,<br>
The seeds of your life’s tragedy were sown at your first session.<br>
Masturbation is hell.<br>
Now, what you must do is quit completely,<br>
Like a chronic smoker quitting cigarettes,<br>
Like a lifelong drunkard giving up alcohol.<br>
You must stop masturbating, no other choice,<br>
Don’t let it destroy your health,<br>
Don’t let it ruin your appearance,<br>
Don’t let it demolish your entire life.<br>
When you finally climb out of masturbation hell,<br>
And breathe your first breath of clean air,<br>
You might even cry out loud,<br>
As the sunshine graces you once more.<br>
Only then will you truly understand what it means to cherish</p>
