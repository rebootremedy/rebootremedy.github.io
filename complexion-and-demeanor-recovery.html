<section id="introduction" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I have seen that some brothers say that arriving at the reboot forum is a blessing for everyone. I agree with this statement. Think about it, the current environment is still dominated by the theory of harmlessness, and online life is still full of this theory. How many people can truly understand the truth about masturbation? Most people are still drowsy and immersed in masturbation under the influence of the harmlessness theory. Those brothers who can stay in the reboot forum are definitely people with blessings and good roots; otherwise, even if they arrive at the forum, they won’t stay. For instance, some people come to the forum and misinterpret its purpose; they are still trapped in the snare of “moderate harmlessness” and cannot break free. This superficial and erroneous understanding is ridiculous and ignorant to the brothers. The more experienced brothers already have a very deep and correct understanding and will not be deceived by “moderate harmlessness.” “Moderate harmlessness” is a beautiful lie that can provide a respectable excuse for your indulgence. With this absurd excuse, you will continue to advance on the path of masturbation until you are completely lost. Only when symptoms explode might you suddenly wake up, as it is said, “you won’t cry until you see the coffin.”</p>
<p>We must value these sanctuaries that are the reboot forums, where there are numerous cases of victims to alert us, as well as experiences of predecessors to learn from. In this forum, you can understand the truth about masturbation. Of course, the meaning of reboot is not limited only to abstaining from lust, but we must also learn how to be a good person and what kind of person we should be. Through the study of traditional culture, you will change your perspective on life and your values, which is very useful for spiritual growth. In abstaining, we must learn the path of health and also learn to do good, shun evil, promote good, do more good deeds, and help others. Only then does life become more meaningful. Helping others is a great joy and the foundation of happiness.</p>
<p>In China, there are more than a hundred million people addicted to masturbation, but very few are fortunate enough to reach the reboot forum and have the opportunity to learn the truth. You can observe your peers and friends; many of them are truly not aware of the dangers of masturbation, and are in a mental state of ignorance and misinformation, which is very sad. Immersing in masturbation in such a mental state undoubtedly awaits them a tragedy in life, and no one in their life tells them about the dangers of masturbation. Some brothers say, “I wish someone had told me earlier!” This phrase is a bit ironic, some people, even if you tell them, will misinterpret your good intention and might even think you are too extreme. Their idea is simply to enjoy, and at that moment they cannot accept unpleasant advice. Maybe they will realize when symptoms appear, or perhaps they never will, and will not understand the truth even unto death. The fact that we can reach the forum and understand the logic behind the reboot is really a blessing for all of us. Let us appreciate this blessing, recover our health and positive energy, and share it with more people.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when personal computers were not as widespread, there was no place to learn the truth about masturbation or to raise awareness; it was a dark era of lust. Now that we can all go to the reboot forums, we have truly arrived at the right time. The theory of reboot is now basically mature, and the foundation of the forums is very solid. The path has already been paved for our brothers. The ancestors planted trees, and future generations enjoy the shade. The cause of reboot in China needs our effort and promotion, as well as our dedication and selfless contribution, to provide valuable successful experiences to the new brothers, so that they can avoid detours and achieve success in rebooting sooner. Let us purify ourselves and society.</p>
<p>People with a high level of awareness would never fall into the bad habit of masturbation because they know that the dangers of masturbation are enormous and that it is a form of perverse lust, so it must be completely eradicated. The pleasure is very brief, but the pain from the symptoms is long-lasting. If you regularly visit the reboot forums, you will definitely know that there are many brothers who have spent thousands on medical expenses, and it is not uncommon to see those who have spent tens of thousands. There are also many who have undergone surgeries, and almost every brother has a tragic story of masturbation behind them.</p>
<p>When we begin to abstain, we must have the correct intention, which is to completely eradicate masturbation. According to feedback from many brothers, many have managed to abstain completely, and although some have not yet reached the state of total abstinence, they have significantly reduced the number of times they masturbate. For example, what was almost a hundred times in six months has now been reduced to less than ten times. And this is not because they do it on purpose, but because they let their guard down or their awareness is not yet high enough, leading to breaking abstinence.</p>
<p>Confucius said: <em>“Aim for the highest and you will reach the middle; aim for the middle and you will get the lowest; if you aim for the lowest, then you will get nothing”</em>. Some brothers start with the wrong intention, thinking about moderating instead of completely abstaining. This is actually an idea of compromise with desire, defeated before starting! This type of brother will definitely break their reboot, as their determination and stance are not firm from the start. As soon as there is a little disturbance, they will waver and break their reboot.</p>
<p>Only when a person has completely subdued desire is it possible that they may really achieve moderation after marriage. That is a very high state, requiring extremely strong control over thoughts. It is like walking on a high wire; only with strong physical and mental control can you walk on the wire hundreds of meters high. Rebooting is to reach that state. Even if you cannot achieve it in the end, your initial intention must be to completely abstain, because <em>“Aim for the highest and you will get the middle; aim for the middle and you will get the lowest”</em>.</p>
<p>If at the beginning you think about moderating, you will definitely not succeed; that is just deceiving yourself. If you have great determination and some insight, and continue learning and raising your awareness, it is entirely possible to completely abstain. In the reboot forums, you already have enough veteran brothers who have entered a stable period of reboot. After entering this period, the feeling of agony disappears, there is basically no involuntary lust, but it is still necessary to maintain high vigilance to protect the results.</p>

<section id="case-studies-4" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="case-studies-4">Case studies</h2>
<p>Here are two case studies of questions and answers:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> I am the one you mentioned who always hovers around 30 days. I relaxed during this time and masturbated excessively. As a result, I have had nocturnal emissions for 3 days. It’s terrible, all the work I had done before was in vain. I really have returned to the starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> At first, doing exercises to strengthen the kidneys worked very well. I had no nocturnal emissions for 36 consecutive days, but on day 37, I had one. However, in the following 10 days, I had nocturnal emissions four times. What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys have a capacity called retention power. The “Suwen” (a classic text of Chinese medicine) says: <em>“The kidneys are responsible for hibernation and are the basis of storage”</em>. Because the retention and storage capacity of the kidneys can prevent the excessive excretion and loss of essence, energy, blood, and bodily fluids, the fuller the kidneys are of essential energy, the more vibrant a person’s vitality will be. However, nocturnal emissions, masturbation, and even sexual intercourse can damage this retention capacity. Some people have a good physical constitution, so they can withstand the damage and will not experience continuous nocturnal emissions. But some brothers have a weaker constitution and unstable retention capacity, resulting in frequent nocturnal emissions.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can cause frequent nocturnal emissions, and one of the main ones is the lack of retention capacity. For example, when we were children in elementary school, we could hold our urine for an entire class without problems. But after damaging the kidneys through masturbation, the retention capacity decreases and we can no longer hold urine or stools. In simple terms, we can no longer “hold it”.</p>
<p>In Chinese medicine, the kidneys control urination and defecation. If we observe older people, they cannot hold urine or stools, maybe not even for ten seconds. If they need to urinate, they must do it immediately, otherwise, they will urinate on themselves. This is actually a manifestation of the decreased retention capacity. As we age and our bodies weaken, we will all reach this point. But now, many brothers are young and already show symptoms of older people. So, what will we do when we get older?</p>
<p>The first case is of someone who was constantly masturbating and damaged their kidneys, resulting in a decrease in their retention capacity, as if a faucet was always open and then could not close properly, becoming a constant leak. Masturbation combined with nocturnal emission is like cutting a tree with two axes, the damage is very great. In the second case, a person managed to strengthen their kidneys, but a nocturnal emission damaged their retention capacity, resulting in 4 leaks in 10 days. In this situation, sufficient attention must be paid after the first nocturnal emission and one must be extremely careful. After the first nocturnal emission, the kidneys should be further strengthened, as this increases the retention capacity. The sleeping posture should be the auspicious posture, and all factors that may cause nocturnal emission should be avoided to prevent the occurrence of consecutive emissions. After a nocturnal emission, intense exercise should be avoided as the body is relatively weak. It is recommended to rest calmly for a few days, practice health exercises, and take walks.</p>
<p>After a nocturnal ejaculation, it is a very special period and is prone to breaking the reboot, as it is easy to feel discouraged and disappointed, which can lead to breaking the reboot. In addition, nocturnal ejaculation can make one return to a state of weakness, so it is necessary to be especially vigilant. As long as it is not a frequent nocturnal ejaculation, there is no need to worry, just continue with the reboot and the cultivation of health. It is important to pay attention to managing emotions. If it is a frequent nocturnal ejaculation, it is necessary to analyze the causes and do a good job in all aspects, such as strengthening the kidneys, adopting the correct sleeping posture, and avoiding factors that may cause nocturnal ejaculation. In this way, the frequency of nocturnal ejaculation can be controlled. With the frequency of nocturnal ejaculation under control, recovery will have a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to the main topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="complexion-facial-appearance" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="complexion-facial-appearance">Complexion and facial appearance</h2>
<p>This season, I will share with everyone my experience on the topics of complexion recovery and facial appearance.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese physiognomy and the facial diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine have surprising similarities. The highest level in Chinese medicine is: <em>“To know by just looking, that is called divine”</em>. The highest level is to know what problem you have in the body by just looking at your face. The story of Bian Que, which I believe everyone has learned, is an example. Bian Que was a master of facial diagnosis, knowing with just one look. Facial diagnosis in Chinese medicine and physiognomy are like two branches of the same tree. A deep understanding of the theory of physiognomy allows us to better and more deeply understand the dangers of masturbation. Almost all classic books on physiognomy have a chapter on facial color, and both Chinese medicine and physiognomy books place great importance on the detailed differentiation of facial color. Next, I will share with everyone my deep understanding of the topic of facial color in physiognomy books:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If the energy is insufficient, nothing will be achieved. If the energy is abundant and the spirit strong, then fortune will be spoken of. Energy produces color, and color determines success or failure.”</p>
<p><em>— The Art of Physiognomy by Liu Zhuang</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qi refers to the Qi of the five organs and six viscera, and the kidneys store the essential Qi of these organs and viscera. The face is the mirror of the five organs and six viscera, so after damaging the kidneys through masturbation, it will be reflected on the face. After masturbation, the color of the face changes easily, and when Qi is insufficient, the color will also change; it will become dark, blue, dirty, and oily, causing a feeling of repulsion.</p>
<p>In severe cases, brothers will experience subtle changes in the shape of their faces, known as deformation. Some brothers have experienced changes in their eyelids, from double to single, and after a period of abstinence, they returned to double eyelids. There are also phenomena of swelling, including swelling of the eyelids, cheeks, and even bags under the eyes. The quality of the skin will also change, becoming rough and no longer smooth and delicate, some brothers experience flaking, enlarged pores, blackheads, juvenile acne, etc., which do not heal for a long time and can leave scars or spots. There are also brothers with sunken cheeks, prominent cheekbones, a ghostly face, and deep dark circles, all these are typical symptoms of kidney damage due to masturbation. In modern society, facing the computer can cause ‘screen face’, and staying up late and sitting for long periods of time also damages the body, so Qi, essence, and spirit are even worse.</p>
<p>Another point is that the brightness of the facial color will also affect the shape of the face. If you have studied photography, you should know that when light and dark change, the shape of the object will also subtly change. Similarly, when the brightness of a person’s face changes, that is, it darkens, the shape of their face will also subtly change.</p>
<p>When a person has kidney deficiency, it is easy to exhibit a symptom, which is: loving to lie down and being lazy. This is also specifically mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine, and everyone should have this experience, that after masturbation, they especially like to sleep, always feel sleepy, and like to stay in bed, which in turn can lead to breaking the reboot and forming a vicious cycle. For a lazy person like this, it is quite difficult to succeed in their career, and it is not an exaggeration to say that they will achieve nothing. The real experiences of many brothers are exactly like this, both in studies and work, everything is a mess and they are not successful in anything. Imagine, if a person has sufficient Qi and spirit, and is full of vitality, with that state to work or study, the efficiency would be completely different, and the results would also be very distinct.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When energy is complete in a month, then it manifests in the color; when the color manifests on the outside, then fortune and misfortune are determined.”</p>
<p><em>— Liuzhuang Shenxiang</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many brothers have commented that, after about a month without masturbating, their vitality has improved, and others have also mentioned that they look more handsome. This is because their complexion has improved, which in turn can cause subtle changes in the shape of the face, making the eyes and skin look brighter, with a fresh and renewed appearance. They also regain their confidence. When you are in good mental shape, you can approach any task with an optimal physical and mental state, which makes it easier to succeed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people who indulge in their desires end up feeling insecure and lacking in confidence, leading to indecisiveness and, in some cases, social phobia. When facing tasks with this attitude, they have already lost half the battle before starting. Excessive masturbation can significantly damage brain capacity, decreasing attention, memory, and critical thinking. This can affect performance, especially in students. Without a good physical and mental state, both study and work can become more difficult.</p>
<p>The complexion reflects a person’s vitality; with a good complexion, one is more energized and can maintain a better state for studying or working. A person full of vitality can positively influence others, making them feel that they are full of positive energy and that they like to be in their company. This feeling is like facing a dirty river, which naturally provokes repulsion, while seeing a clean spring brings joy and a natural inclination towards it.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The Qi is stored within the skin, but its color is shown on the outside. If the roots are solid, the branches and leaves will be abundant. If the roots dry up, the branches and leaves will fade”, “When Qi flows, the color is bright. When Qi is calm, the color is serene. When Qi circulates, the brightness and clarity are reflected in the color. These are signs of good energy and color. If Qi is unbalanced, the color becomes arid. If Qi is stagnant, the color becomes dry. If Qi is obstructed, paleness and darkness appear in the color. These are signs of unfavorable Qi and color”, “If the color is bright, the nature is calm. If the color is dark, the emotions are turbulent. The bright color is like the autumn moon filling the sky. The dark color is like the floating clouds that hide the sun. Tranquility is auspicious. Turbulence is ominous.”</p>
<p><em>— Shen Xiang Tie Guan Dao</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relationship between Qi and color is that Qi is the root of color. Qi is the most fundamental, and the kidneys are the root of the five internal organs, in addition to storing the essence of Qi from the five organs and six viscera. Therefore, the Qi of the kidneys is of utmost importance, equivalent to the king of kings. If the kidneys are weak, it is easy for the five organs and six viscera to become unbalanced and various symptoms to appear. That is why traditional Chinese medicine says that kidney weakness leads to the proliferation of diseases, and this statement is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Sun Simiao, the “King of Medicine,” said that <em>“lack of essence leads to disease”</em>, which actually means the same thing. Masturbation not only damages the Qi and color but also the skin. According to my observations, at that time I had the worst skin among my friends, and it worsened after masturbation. Although others also masturbate, the symptoms vary from person to person. Later, while studying traditional Chinese medicine, I understood that this is closely related to individual constitution. Traditional Chinese medicine classifies people into nine types of constitution, and the problems caused by masturbation vary according to the constitution, each with its own characteristics. Some people may masturbate without their skin being affected, but others may experience significant deterioration of the skin after only a few times.</p>
<p>However, nature is fair; if they do not have skin problems, they may have other serious issues, such as hair loss, back pain, insomnia, or a tendency to be irritable, among other symptoms. Moreover, even if their skin does not have problems, their complexion will change due to masturbation. Regardless of the constitution, everyone’s complexion will worsen, and this is indisputable. When your kidney Qi is abundant, like that of a child, your skin will be delicate, soft, shiny, and translucent, which will naturally cheer people up. When your skin is dull and dirty, like overripe fruit or a wilted flower, both you and others will feel disgusted. By staying away from lust and taking care of your health, both your skin and your complexion will gradually improve. Countless experiences of people who have quit masturbation and their before-and-after photos have fully confirmed this.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A man must be firm and upright; his energy must be strong, and his nature must be just. To be strong means not to be flattering, to be upright means not to be perverse. He who possesses the energy of firmness and uprightness is the exceptional talent of the world.”</p>
<p><em>— Yuguan Zhaoshenju</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing for a man is to have an upright and strong spirit. A gentleman should be open and fair, but here righteousness does not mean being excessively rigid, as being too rigid can lead to breaking. Righteousness here refers to a balance between firmness and flexibility, being outwardly gentle but inwardly firm. This righteousness does not mean that you should boast or display your strength everywhere. By possessing an upright and strong spirit, you will not fall into the addiction to masturbation and stop being despicable.</p>
<p>To develop this spirit, you must continually nourish yourself with positive energy. With upright morality within you, evil will not affect you. If your heart is upright, you will be upright; if your heart is pure, you will be pure. By abstaining from lust, we seek to straighten our hearts, purify our minds, and eliminate all the dirt and corruption, renewing ourselves to regain purity and sunlight, endowing us with a virile and upright spirit. Wherever you go, carry with you this aura of righteousness; its energy is like the spring breeze, which brings life and vitality wherever it blows.</p>
<p>If you carry with you an air of despicableness, you will not be welcome anywhere. You might even find that your relationship with your parents becomes strained and that you cannot communicate normally with others. The root of this is corruption from pornography and the damage to the spirit caused by addiction to masturbation. Without a spirit, you lack confidence, become shy, reluctant to interact with others, and fearful of being scorned.</p>
<p>To change this unbalanced state of body and mind, the only solution is to study more about reboot and traditional culture, increase your awareness and positive energy, and thus rebuild your confidence. Many who have practiced reboot report that their mood has improved, they dare to look others in the eyes, and they communicate more naturally. This is actually a manifestation of body and mind adjustment and the recovery of the upright spirit. Once you have enough spirit, everything you do will flow smoothly; even in the face of temporary setbacks, you will be able to face them with optimism and joy. Your mood will be completely different, more proactive and optimistic.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If the face is slanted and defective and the color is dull, these are unfavorable signs. If the complexion is as white as jade, as black as lacquer, as yellow as steamed chestnuts, and as purple as silk, these are auspicious signs.”</p>
<p><em>— From “The Complete Compilation of Divine Physiognomy”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph primarily discusses the brightness, transparency, and clarity of the complexion. Many after masturbating may have noticed that after doing so, their complexion visibly darkens, like a lantern running out of battery, and the skin color becomes very uneven. Those who know makeup understand that there are specific products to brighten and even out the skin tone. When the skin color is brightened, the person’s appearance is completely renewed. Of course, makeup is artificial, and many women reveal their true appearance upon removing makeup, showing dull and lifeless skin, lacking in luster.</p>
<p>The endocrine disorders caused by masturbation will have many negative effects on people’s faces: for example, the skin of some brothers will become oily and they will have the feeling that no matter how they wash it, it cannot be cleaned, or the more I wash it, the more oil comes out, no matter how many times I wash it, it feels dirty, yet still very dull. Actually, this is because there is internal dirt and hormonal imbalance. Washing more on the outside does not help, not even with disinfectant. When you persist in rebooting, actively exercise, have regular breaks, and persist for a period of time, the skin will naturally clear up. Many brothers have personal experience: by persisting in rebooting and maintaining health, their skin becomes clear and radiant again. But by breaking the reboot, you immediately return to the starting point, become ugly, vulgar, and lose confidence in yourself.</p>
<p>Due to genetics or sun exposure, each person has a different skin tone: some are paler, others darker, some yellow, and some purple. But no matter what the skin color, if it is bright, luminous, clear, and translucent, it is considered a good skin color. Conversely, if the skin is dull, uneven, with dark spots, and looks dusty, these are not signs of a good skin color. This type of skin color is actually an external manifestation of an internal imbalance. The skin color is an expression of what is inside.</p>
<p>Masturbation damages the kidneys, causes dysfunction in internal organs, and disrupts hormones, which will definitely be reflected on the face. Any observant person can notice this. Additionally, rebooting can also brighten a person’s eyes. There is a difference between bright eyes and dull eyes; a superficial brightness is not a good sign. The best eyes are bright yet reserved, like the difference between the brightness of a glass ball and that of a piece of jade. The glass ball has a superficial shine without depth, while jade emits a subtle and internal light. The changes in appearance after masturbation are subtle yet evident. When the damage is severe, one looks despicable and energy-less.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the changes in appearance after rebooting are also subtle; only careful observation can reveal their mysteries. When people say you look handsomer, have your facial features changed? Why do they say you look better? It’s because after stopping masturbation, subtle yet significant changes have occurred that are difficult to describe but evident at first glance. Look at small children, is there anyone who is particularly ugly? Almost none, because they have good vital energy and skin color, and their bright and lively eyes cheer anyone up. For a man, the most important thing is not his facial features, but his vitality and skin color. A man may not be handsome, but he cannot lose his vitality; losing it is really being a fool. Many men who used to be handsome have become ugly; once they lose their vitality, no matter how handsome they were before, they become despicable and ugly. This is the personal experience of many handsome men: masturbation can transform a handsome man into a deteriorated and finally a despicable man. This is absolutely true.</p>

<section id="appearance-recovering" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="appearance-recovering">Appearance and skin color recovering</h2>
<p>Next, we will talk about the secret to recovering appearance and skin color.</p>
<p>The content of this season is of great concern to many brothers because after masturbating, many brothers have become ugly. Becoming ugly is a relatively common phenomenon. I also talked in detail about the various types of ugliness in the season of becoming ugly. This season we will talk about how to restore your appearance and complexion.</p>
<p>Recovering the appearance and skin color is a profound topic. The phenomenon of becoming ugly after masturbation manifests when the essence has been damaged. After indulgence, a person’s appearance and skin color begin to deteriorate. Although it may not be so evident in adolescence, after the age of 25 it becomes more noticeable. I started masturbating in puberty and already had a hormonal imbalance at that time. Although I did not become too ugly, I could no longer compare with my appearance before masturbation. Then, in college, I began to have dark circles and bags under my eyes. I remember after masturbating during one summer, I looked in the mirror and noticed that I had bags under my eyes. The bags under the eyes make a person look tired and aged. I also noticed that after masturbation, I started to have more wrinkles. With a sense of crisis, I began running every day, as I had a lot of free time in college. I ran long distances every day for more than twenty days, and then, upon looking in the mirror, I noticed that the dark circles and bags under my eyes had disappeared and I looked much more energetic. However, at that time I was still in a brute-force and blind reboot, and it was not long before I fell back into masturbation and returned to my previous state, with the bags under the eyes reappearing. So I started running again, and found myself struggling between running and relapsing, feeling very distressed and helpless.</p>
<p>Through my personal experience, I have found that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on recovering appearance and alleviating prostatitis. However, if you do not completely stop masturbating, you will lose attractiveness again after relapsing, so the most crucial thing is to completely quit masturbation. After starting to work, it’s not possible to exercise every day, and sometimes, when the work is too exhausting, you don’t feel like exercising. Exercise acts as a balance for the damage caused by masturbation, but as you age, you will find that your body recovers increasingly slowly after exercise and masturbation. This is because the body’s recovery capacity significantly decreases with age. At 30 years, the recovery capacity is approximately half of what it was at 20 years. Even if you are in good physical shape, if you have a history of essence damage due to masturbation, it’s likely you will experience some symptoms by the time you reach 30 years. The extravagance in youth is paid for in old age; many think that indulgence in youth has no consequences, but in reality, they are depleting their future health.</p>
<p>In general, ugliness can be classified into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in shape<br>
</li>
<li>Changes in skin color<br>
</li>
<li>Changes in skin texture</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the three main categories. Some people have decent skin, but their skin color is pale as a ghost. Others have acceptable skin and skin color, but their face has become deformed. Most people experience negative changes in all three aspects: skin texture, skin color, and shape. Surely many of you have tried various methods to recover your appearance, such as using facial cleansers, Chinese herbal treatments, face masks, etc.</p>
<p>I remember one brother tried laser treatment, and after a while, his skin improved. However, he continued masturbating and breaking his reboot, and it wasn’t long before his skin worsened again. Then he went back to the hospital for another laser treatment and posted a message saying he hated himself for not being able to stop masturbating. Those who have good exercise habits should understand the true meaning of the phrase “exercise is the best makeup for a man”. After a period of aerobic exercise, both the skin and skin color will improve. If you continue to maintain the habit, facial deformation problems will also slowly improve. But you must never break your abstinence; if you do, it’s very likely that all your previous effort will be lost and you’ll return to the starting point.</p>
<p>Staying up late also damages the appearance and can cause dark circles, which I believe many brothers have experienced. Therefore, we must develop good sleep and exercise habits. Good sleep is actually a beauty lesson; the so-called beauty sleep means that if you sleep well, you will wake up in the morning and look in the mirror with a better skin color. If you stay up late, you will feel very tired and lacking in energy in the morning. But what I mean is that, masturbation damages vitality so much that even sleeping may not restore your appearance.</p>
<p>Aerobic exercise can improve appearance, but it requires perseverance. Recovery of appearance can easily enter a period of stagnation, in which you feel it is difficult to achieve significant improvement, no matter what you do. Even using the best skincare products has limited effect and, in addition, they are very expensive, so most people seeking to abstain from masturbation cannot afford them. Many skincare products can also easily cause skin allergies.</p>
<p>Restoring appearance and complexion is indeed one of the most challenging aspects of recovery. Relying solely on rebooting is extremely difficult to achieve complete recovery unless you have started masturbating only recently. Otherwise, to achieve true recovery, you must find solutions in recovery methods.</p>
<p>In this season, I will share a secret for recovering appearance and skin color. I have read countless articles and books on health and wellness, but I have never seen anyone recommend this method. This method is something I fully understood through my own practice; it can be said to be an exclusive recovery technique. It has a surprising effect on recovering appearance and skin color. You should know my character; I do not exaggerate when I say that the recovery effect is amazing, even surpassing premium skincare products. Most importantly, it is completely free and totally natural.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in previous articles, I used to suffer from neurosis. Those brothers who suffer from neurosis should know that medications cannot cure neurosis; they can only alleviate it. To fully recover from neurosis, great effort must be made in the realm of wellness and increasing health care awareness. I understood this principle at that time, so I did not place all my hopes of recovery on the doctor, but continued studying articles about wellness to improve my health care awareness. I often went to the park for walks and saw many retirees walking along paths, and I followed behind them, which was equivalent to massaging the acupuncture points on the soles of the feet, but I did not maintain this practice for long. Later, I saw some elderly people hitting trees; those who have been to parks might know about this, which consists of hitting your back against a tree, equivalent to massaging and hitting the acupuncture points and meridians on the back. So I also started hitting trees, and I must say the results were good. Originally, I had a sense of discomfort in my back, and after hitting the tree for a few days, I felt much more comfortable, but I also did not maintain this tree-hitting therapy. However, through the experience of hitting trees, I developed a certain special affection for trees, so I started researching online whether trees can cure diseases, and indeed I found something. See the following text:</p>
<p>[Dendrotherapy refers to the use of trees to treat diseases. The use of trees for medicinal purposes is widespread among common people and there are also examples in medicine. Indian yoga believes that trees can transmit to people a substance they obtain from the universe. Different species of trees carry different types of energy. Some help restore vitality, others have anti-inflammatory properties, and others prevent diseases. Oaks energize people, spruces can absorb negative energies, pines can transmit beneficial energies, and the bark of poplars can alleviate toothache. A Russian dictionary says, “When the feet hurt, place poplar wood on them; when the head hurts, place it on the head.” Modern researchers of tree therapy are experts in biolocation. They believe that trees have a biofield and that the therapeutic effect of trees on people is due to the action of this biofield. Experts from the UK Health Institute believe that the energy of trees is sufficient to heal diseases and that their effectiveness is not necessarily inferior to that of drugs. Those who regularly practice Qigong in the forest may have this experience: if they practice near birches, oaks, pines, cypresses, or firs, they will feel energized and refreshed, and any minor ailment will quickly disappear. It is already known that trees can not only “supply energy” but also “absorb diseases.”]</p>
<p>I first saw this text over three years ago. At that time, I felt that tree therapy made some sense, but I also thought the theory behind tree therapy was quite mystical and it was unclear whether it was truly effective. However, I had already started practicing it by going to the park to touch trees, which I maintained for about half a month. At that time, I didn’t feel anything special, and now I realize that it was probably because I wasn’t paying enough attention and wasn’t applying the method correctly, like Zhu Bajie eating ginseng fruits without tasting them. When I touched the trees, I didn’t have a very delicate experience. Therefore, I did not continue with the practice, but in my close contact with nature, I could clearly feel that my mood was more easily relaxed, which is very effective for regulating psychological state.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until three years later, that is, last month, that I really understood the relationship between tree therapy and appearance and skin color. At that time, I didn’t intend to use tree therapy to recover my appearance and skin color; I just felt the desire to get close and hug the trees, driven by that emotion and thought. Through my studies on energy fields, I knew that everything has its own energy field and that these fields can interact and influence each other. Humans are also surrounded by an energy field, although it is not visible to the human eye, just like trees. At that time, I wondered if I could use the energy field of trees to purify my own energy field. I don’t know where this idea came from, but I went to hug a tree. Hugging in this way can provide spiritual comfort and physical and mental relaxation. At the moment of the hug, the tree’s energy field is already influencing your energy field. When I hugged the tree, I recited the name of Buddha, because scientific research has shown that plants also have emotions. We should be grateful to plants, as without them, our air would be terrible. So, while reciting the name of Buddha and hugging the tree, I could feel the calm and peaceful energy field of the tree, which could instantly calm my restless mind.</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice in my head told me that I should hug the tree with both hands and place the Yintang (third eye) between my eyebrows against the tree, and then I should visualize the tree’s energy entering my body through the Laogong points (palms of the hands) and Yintang, purifying my energy field. At the same time, I should maintain an attitude of deep gratitude towards the tree. That’s how I did it. Three years earlier, when I approached the trees, I only touched them with my hands and didn’t bring my face close. But when I brought my face close to the tree for three days, about two hours each day, a miracle occurred. I can only describe it as a miracle because I can’t find another word that better expresses what I felt at that moment. On the fourth day, I got up in the morning, washed my face, and when I looked in the mirror, I noticed that my skin color had improved significantly. My face was much cleaner than before and started to look more translucent and full. That feeling of fullness reminded me of that of a child before development, with the face exceptionally clean, with no need for any facial cleanser or skincare product. If you look at a child’s face, you’ll see that it is very round and full, as if it were inflated from the inside. At the same time, I felt that my skin tone had become more even, and my skin color had lightened significantly. Then, my confidence increased and I began to practice tree therapy more frequently. In about a week, the dirt in my pores began to come out gradually, but my skin tone was still very clear. When the dirt was almost completely removed, my skin color improved even more. I personally experienced how the tree’s energy field purified my own energy field and regulated my hormones, which also stabilized and calmed my mood.</p>
<p>Next, I will share some more detailed experiences. After touching trees with both hands for two hours, an hour after returning home I noticed that my palms had become thicker. It’s a very intuitive feeling. My mother even said, ‘How come your hands suddenly got much thicker?’ This increase in thickness is mentioned in physiognomy, indicating abundance of Qi and good fortune. I remember a farmer and President Xi Jinping shook hands, and the farmer exclaimed, ‘What thick palms!’ I have persisted until now, and my palms have increased almost a quarter in thickness compared to before, a very noticeable change.</p>
<p>Additionally, my hair loss has decreased considerably. By rebooting and cultivating health, my hair loss and graying had already significantly improved and returned to normal. Through tree therapy, I found that my hair loss has decreased even further. Before, I used to lose about 5 hairs a day, but now it has reduced to 1-2 hairs, or even no hair loss at all. It makes a lot of sense in traditional Chinese medicine. Trees represent the Qi of wood, while hair is an external manifestation of the liver’s wood and the kidney’s water. The hair is the essence of the kidneys, and the liver stores blood, and hair is blood. By replenishing the Qi of wood, hair loss issues can improve considerably, that’s my personal experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, trees are very special. They not only absorb the Qi of wood but also absorb the five Qis of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They absorb the essence of heaven and earth, the spiritual energy of the sun and the moon. I believe all mysteries are in nature. Einstein once said you could talk about a drop of water for three days without finishing. A drop of water contains physical knowledge that surpasses human imagination, the most common but also the most profound.</p>
<p>Then, I discovered that different trees have different auras, just like different trees you touch, you will find that their body temperature is different. Some trees have a low body temperature, while others feel warm when touched. I have touched many trees and found that large trees have a more powerful aura. Also, among various types of trees, ginkgos and camphor trees feel the best.</p>
<p>Additionally, trees with “Qi points” also have a good effect. What are “Qi points”? Qi points are the growth points of trees, which are the branch growth points. Growth points are actually where Qi emanates outward. If you put your hand on the growth point, you will absorb more Qi and the effect will be more evident. However, it is not easy to find trees with growth points, and there are also trees whose growth points are too high to reach.</p>
<p>Next, I summarize the key points of tree therapy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a tree, I recommend ginkgo or camphor, with an age of more than ten years and a relatively clean trunk. Of course, you can also try other trees.<br>
</li>
<li>Hold the trunk of the tree with both hands, place the Yintang between the eyebrows against the trunk, and visualize the purifying energy of the tree entering your body from the Laogong points and Yintang to purify your aura.<br>
</li>
<li>Press your cheeks against the tree trunk, doing it separately, first the left cheek and then the right, each for more than 20 minutes.<br>
</li>
<li>Maintain calmness and a grateful heart. Those who believe in Buddha can recite his name.<br>
</li>
<li>Try to practice during the day, better if there is sunlight.<br>
</li>
<li>Each practice session should last at least 2 hours, but if you are very busy, at least maintain it for more than 1 hour.<br>
</li>
<li>The day after each practice session, wash your face upon waking and pay attention to the effects, observing the subtle positive changes that occur.<br>
</li>
<li>Orientation towards the sun is key, do not hug in the shadow of the tree, choose a large and clean trunk that receives direct sunlight.<br>
</li>
<li>The choice of tree type is important, trees like eucalyptus are not suitable.<br>
</li>
<li>You do not need to visualize; if you are bored, you can listen to music.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had never before associated tree therapy with improving appearance and complexion, but by chance, I discovered the secret and the effect was truly astonishing! The reason I say that tree therapy is better than premium skincare products is that it can purify your aura and adjust endocrine effects, rather than just working on the surface. Even the best cosmetics only act on the surface and cannot purify your aura, but trees can, and the effect on improving skin quality and complexion is absolutely remarkable and surprising, and it is also very effective for improving deformation. If you are a careful practitioner, you will definitely feel the huge impact of tree therapy on recovering appearance— it’s really powerful! It’s not an exaggeration to say it has miraculous effects. A few days of practice can help you quickly overcome stagnation in recovering your appearance and complexion.</p>
<p>However, tree therapy has one downside: it can make people look at you strangely. Ordinary people might wonder what you are doing and why you are hugging a tree. They might be curious or even think you are crazy. I have encountered people staring at me, but I don’t care at all. Some things you only need to know yourself, don’t worry about what others think.</p>
<p>I hope that brothers who have become ugly can actively practice. After a week of practice, there will definitely be a surprising performance. If it’s fast, there will be a major change in three days. That kind of change in appearance and complexion is subtle but very intuitive, and it will be very obvious when looking in the mirror. I hope everyone will share the effects and feelings of the practice with me, so that I can accumulate some cases.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to thank the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for their blessing. Finally, I would like to thank Buddha and Bodhisattvas for their blessing. I believe it was their blessing that allowed me to understand this magical recovery method and share it with everyone. I hope everyone can regain their appearance and vitality, regain long-lost confidence, but I do not expect everyone to cling too much to their appearance. People will always age, some things must be left to flow naturally. Helping others and improving the quality of your soul is what’s most important. Namo Amitabha Buddha! Namo Shakyamuni Buddha! Namo Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva!</p>
<p>Quote: We enjoy both the process and the result of running. The process is often difficult and even painful, but the result is usually acceptable. You gain a healthy body, full of vitality and love. Yes, what I want to express is that after exercising, you will appreciate yourself and this body more, which can coexist harmoniously with the various environments of nature.</p>
